If you're working on something exciting — let’s talk!

## Service Menu
- **Product Engineering:** Feature delivery with clean architectures, automated tests, and CI/CD readiness.
- **API & Integrations:** REST/WebSocket design, third-party integrations, performance tuning.
- **Frontend Craft:** Responsive UIs in Vue.js with smooth interactions and strong accessibility defaults.
- **Reliability:** Containerized environments (Docker), monitoring hooks, and graceful degradation patterns.

## Collaboration Principles
- 📐 Plan before coding: clarify requirements, risks, and interfaces.
- 🧪 Test early: unit, integration, and contract tests to prevent regressions.
- 🔄 Iterate transparently: regular checkpoints, demo-ready increments, and clear documentation.
- 🔍 Measure what matters: latency budgets, error budgets, and user-centric metrics.
